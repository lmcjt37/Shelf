# Shelf 📚
---
This is the home of a new mobile app that will be focused around the world of books. The aim is to help to seamlessly explore new and old books, create your own shelfs whether they be books you want to read, are currently reading or want to remember and return to.

### Idea 💡

This will initially be an educational project for [Hacktoberefest 2023](https://hacktoberfest.com/) and hopefully at the end we'll have developed a working mobile app. I want to take my experience as a mobile developer and help contribute and share knowledge around building mobile apps, as well as help bridge the knowledge gap between those seeking to try something new even if you're coming from a web background.

### Getting Started 🏎️

Follow the installation guide from [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/), once all the tooling is installed then you can continue

Install the project dependencies and then run the expo development server, the cli will ask you what you want to develop on.

`yarn install && npx expo start`

### Contribution 🙏

To contribute, simply follow the best practices and guidelines provided by [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#beginner-resources)

Additionally, because the project is mobile focused and built using [Expo](https://expo.dev/), please make sure to refer to the docs when picking up any tickets to help steer you in the right direction.

If you ever require more direction then please reach out and we can ideate the steps and actions to guide the project.
